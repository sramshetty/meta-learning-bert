It's great at drying me off while i'm working out and yet the towel isn't wet. I am conflicted though. I bought this one when I lost the one I already had. It's a bit thinner and not the same deminsion as the original, but I still like it for what it does. I also like the little bag that it comes in, which I didn't have with the original one"}]
